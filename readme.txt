The Covid-19 pandemic forced colleges across India to hold classes over the online mode. With this came the need to take screenshots of the online live lectures so that the pics can be used efficiently during examination time. This project is a simple implementation of my creative idea: "Why not automate the process of taking screenshots?"

1) The project has 2 python scripts: (a) screenShotTaker.py     (b) duplicateDeletion.py

2) First the screenShotTaker.py needs to be run. To stop it use key-board interrupt. Then run duplicateDeletion.py to delete duplicate images.
